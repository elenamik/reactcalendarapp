overall:
    connect all fields with redux


alg:
    do not decrement if input already present
    have the alg run based on the current store. have added event trigger 
        process that re-calculates days left (using the alg)
        this makes it easier to not count holidays, weekends, multiple days selected, etc

un-numbered days:
    fade out 
    make unclickable
    (have to add type to box)

header: 
    ability to specify some options - rest of stuff should not be clickable before this
    day accrual, amount of days
    

side bar:
    options image
    animate the entrance
    
calendar:
    add more than one day
    display if out of days
    display total amount of days left - floating
    wrap input
    hover over:edit and x options
    click once to edit
    double click to show more detail

form:
    fit to box 
    make it look prettier - have it pop up like event already

holidays:
    when added, check to make sure its not holiday or weekend to decrement
    load holidays (from default,changable in options)

options:
    color scheme changes
    edit holidays
    should render css box that aligns via grid elements, but counts as many days (yikes!)
    cal grayed out until # of days is made available 
    check box for accrual options
    animation of it flying out
    when scrolling past: shows at top daysleft/total
    reset button
    

undo/redo
slide clickable
save to account and DB!! - weekend job for sure
