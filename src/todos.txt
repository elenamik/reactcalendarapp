MORE INTUITIVE EXPERIENCE:
    can automatically type when clicked, add cursor right away
    add redux :-(-:
    input holidays - will automatically set type=holiday
    put x button to cancel current input
    when clicked, can delete any typed event
    can click an event to change value

LONG WAYS AWAY:
    window to put in own holidays
    saving and loading notes/configuration to account
    configurable colors(UI)
