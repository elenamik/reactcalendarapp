NEXT GOALS:
    display total days left in top (aggregate days)
    render entire thing
    refactor code with redux / modularity in mind
    have states updated with redux :'-)

MORE INTUITIVE EXPERIENCE:
    can automatically type when clicked, add cursor right away
    add redux :-(-:
    input holidays - will automatically set type
    put x button to cancel current input
    when clicked, can delete any typed event
    can click an event to change value

LONG WAYS AWAY:
    option for:
        accrument (assign all, or give amount each month)
        distributing days evenly
        just displaying days left
    window to put in own holidays
    saving and loading notes/configuration to account
    configurable colors(UI)
    

MAYBE TWO MONTHS FROM NOW:
    turn into just an event tracker in app format
