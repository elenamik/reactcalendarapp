TODO

REFACTORING:
- !!!
- change structure of files (in src)
- make form its own component if possible? - its possible
- fix use of state in day (inputted day)

FIX INPUTTING:
- do not delete input upon clicking again
- holidays different from inputted events
- make input box look nicer?
- dont allow input if there is no day number

FORMATTING:
- do not have submit be larger than cell
- the month header is like one pixel off :)) maybe add a border?
- make it look prettier (material-ui or something similar)

LOGIC:
- days left algorithm
- update days left and trickle down to children

SECURITY:
- write library to sanitize input 

long ways away:
- link to account (will need to store on server-side, whole other mess)
- user can choose colors of events?
- header/routing
- switching modes - accrued, all total
- choosing how many days are off/ accrued
- expand box to reveal/add more granular details
